# ETH-Bank
## Bank for Ether. 

This is a project that allows users to deposit and withdraw `Ether` with respect to the amount they have deposited and their deposit plans.

## Depositing
Users can deposit Ether into their personal accounts, their accounts of course will be protected by password, hashed off-chain, and then set onchain.
Deposits will vary based on the users current plan grouped into:
- [x] Free (Up to 1 Ether).
- [x] Basic (Up to 5 Ether).
- [x] Pro (Up to 10 Ether).
- [x] Ultimate (Unlimited Ether).

## Withdrawals
Like deposits, withdrawals are also dependent on the users plan, and the limits are the same.
